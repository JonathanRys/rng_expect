# RNG Expect

This app calculates the distiribution of a set of results for a random drawing.

If there is a lot of variability between susequent runs of the same numbers, try increasing the repititions.

If there is low variablility and the runs are taking too long, try reducing the number of repititions.

#### Future Enhancements

Add ability to retain results of previous runs and add to them rather than starting a new run each time
